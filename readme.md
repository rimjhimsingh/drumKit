# 🥁 Drum Kit

**Drum Kit** is a fun and interactive web-based drum kit built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking the corresponding buttons or using the keyboard. 🎶

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **personal learning exercise** where I practiced using **JavaScript** to add interactivity to a webpage. I explored event listeners, functions, and audio playback in JavaScript while creating something enjoyable!

### 🏆 Features:
- **Interactive Drum Buttons**: Click on any of the buttons to play a unique drum sound.
- **Keyboard Support**: Use the keyboard to play sounds by pressing the corresponding letters (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`).
- **Responsive Layout**: A simple, responsive design that works across different devices.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of **JavaScript** by working on:
- Handling **event listeners** for clicks and keyboard events.
- Playing audio files using JavaScript's `Audio` object.
- Implementing control flow with `switch` statements to map different keys to different sounds.
  
It also provided a great opportunity to practice **DOM manipulation** and create a user-friendly, interactive experience.
